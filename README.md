# F# Scrum onion architecture sample

*Got a comment or a question? Don't hesitate to drop me an email or open an issue.*

This sample focuses on applying functional constructs over cluing together
libraries and frameworks. It substitutes the .NET dependency injection
container, FluentValidation, MediatR, Entity Framework, Moq, Respawn, and a
migration tool for simpler constructs.

It's an example of imperative shell, functional core. Specifically, `Program.fs`
and `Infrastructure.fs` make up the shell while `Application.fs` and `Domain.fs`
make up the core.

Where F# shines is in the core and `IntegrationTest.fs`. The shell is similar in
nature to many C# applications.

The application has the following features:

- REST API adhering to the [Zalando API
guidelines](https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/) with JWTs
supporting role-based security.
- A simple identity provider to issue, renew, and inspect JWTs accepted by the
  REST API.
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) access to the application
  layer from clients.
- Paged responses for endpoints which return collections.
- Integration tests with the ability to fake any dependency.
- Database migrations and initial data seeding.
- ASP.NET health checks for memory and database.
- k6 load test with baseline under `tests/k6`.
- Architecture decision records under `docs/architecture-decision-records`.

The Scrum domain was chosen because it offers sufficient complexity and everyone
is familiar with it, though most aspects of the application is illustrated with
stories and tasks only.

With only stories and tasks, onion architecture may seem to introduce a
disproportional amount of complexity. A larger domain and integrations with
external services is where onion architecture starts to pays off.

That said, not every project requires an implementation of every concept from
onion architecture and domain driven design. Those should be scaled up or down
based on actual business complexity.

## Getting started

Running the tests or the web app creates the SQLite databases in the Git root as
`scrum_web.sqlite` and `scrum_test.sqlite`.

    $ dotnet tool restore
    $ dotnet build
    $ dotnet test
    $ dotnet run --project src/Scrum

Opening the Git repository with VSCode will make it pick up the DevContainer
configuration.
